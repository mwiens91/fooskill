# fooskill

fooskill is a **work-in-progress** web app for managing foosball leagues
and leaderboards using Django, the Django REST Framework, and React.
Details about the rating system, setting up a fooskill dev server, and
how to contribute [are available in the
docs](https://fooskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Project status

The backend for fooskill is 100% finished. However, the frontend is
still in development. Currently, the project is on an unofficial hiatus
(waiting for a replacement foosball table in our school's common room,
should one arrive).
